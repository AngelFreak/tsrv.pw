Well you kind of need to create this first post right?

I felt really akward writing this, but it had to be done.

There are many reasons why i started this blog. Firstly i wanted to try it out, and see if i enjoy it. Much of this will be a experiment, and there will be some bad and weird posts, no doubt!. Secondly i wanted to try out https://gohugo.io/ sooo thats what this blog is made in. Lastly and most importantly i wanted a website to represent myself on the web, not on google, facebook or anywhere else, but on my one site that i host myself.

So i cretaed this site that i host myself, at home, on a desent OS, with Let's encrypt and all the other good stuff.

The site is hosted on a Void Linux server, in a docker container, running nginx and let's encrypt.
I will make a post in the feature about this setup, but for now this is it.
